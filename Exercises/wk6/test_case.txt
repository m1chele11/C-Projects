this is a test run
folowed by control dd
expected output should be:
0( 4):  1 this
6(7):  1 is 
..... etc 
this test case is supposed to test the program. Although it has some bugs I was not able to figure out, i really struggled with this assignment. but it compiles and have ultimatly learned a couple new things. 
bugs: counter, and indexing the duplicates
