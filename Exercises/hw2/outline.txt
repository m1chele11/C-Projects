we have the global variables: 
A,S,R,J,T,H 
each has their corresponding sub variabels
we will also use variables to keep track of each average

do while loop{
to run unless "Q" is entered
for loop to validate the input with if statement inside{
}
switch(input){
	there will be multiple cases for each employee type
		for loop{
			this will be inside each case to validate the user input and ask until correct input is entered
		}	
	}
}
print final results after the program is exited with "Q"
